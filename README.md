# VideoUnderstanding
Basic trials of running VLMs locally on my 5080 to analyze my drone videos.


## Goal
I want to be able to ask questions about my library of videos and be able to extract certain scenes without looking at all of the videos myself. For this first iteration I would like to collect all scenes where I fly over a lake. The input would be a list of videos, the output a collection of timestamps per video.
